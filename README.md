# Eyes Deceive

# Brief Project Description 
This SPA is created in React with a component in TypeScript. It is a final project for the JavaScript Library course in frontend development education at ITHS.

# Description 
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate skills in the JavaScript library, React, for the JavaScript Library course. Using a JSON file, the app retrieves information, and depending on the information, the components are rendered. One of the components is written in TypeScript. The idea for the app came when I wanted to experiment with CSS and animated backgrounds. I wanted to create two sides of each component, one static and one animated. There is almost no text, just a lot of symbols for users to explore and be surprised. And perhaps a bit dizzy along the way.
